## Using Smartphone BLE RSSI Values to Classify Proximity with Deep Neural Networks

### 4 different scenarios
- [x] Data collection with Devices 3 feet apart in an indoor open space.
- [x] Data collection with Devices 9 feet apart in an indoor open space.
- [ ] Data collection with Devices 3 feet apart with an interior wall in between.
- [ ] Data collection with Devices 9 feet apart with an interior wall in between.


| Scenario  | Conditions                    | Target |
|-----------|-------------------------------|--------|
| open3feet | - 3 feet apart <br> - Indoor space |    1   |
| open9feet | - 9 feet apart <br> - Indoor space  |    0   |
| wall9feet | - 3 feet apart <br> - Indoor wall in between  |    0   |
| wall9feet | - 9 feet apart <br> - Indoor wall in between  |    0   |
